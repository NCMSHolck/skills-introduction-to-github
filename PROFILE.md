#Welcome to

A friend of my son's indicated that the tutorial wasn't helping him understand the concepts.
I've been coding for awhile so hoping to help him out.

The video for "What is Git" was incredibly unhelpful marketing plugs instead of something to help you understand why you need a repository and versioning.

# Why Repositories and Versioning
Have you ever tried to share files with someone else?  In the pre-cloud days you could email files back and forth, but knowing who made changes when got hard to track and the multiple copies of the files often caused changes to get lost

Along came versioning software.  Git was not the first, but it gained popularity and became a bit defacto.  Having a public, shareable repository platform helped.

Versioning software allows you to track changes to files and even folders.  To keep your changes separate from someone else's you create a "branch" ... imagine a tree.  The trunk is the "main" branch that all other branches stem from.  Only it is a fancy arborist tree where the branches eventually merge back into the trunk ... or not if they get trimmed because they don't look good.
You can collaborate on a branch by allowing others to branch from your branch.
You can create separate branches to organize the work into smaller pieces.

You can work on your changes separately from someone else and keep them in a local copy.  When you are ready to share your changes, you commit your changes to the branch ... or if you decide you want to throw them away you can do that to ... or if you want to go back several versions you can revert your changes.  There are lots of options to control what changes are kept.

Branch history is tracked so you can see what changes were made, who made them, and when they were made.
